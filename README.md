## INTRODUTION

- This Detection is done using an XML file called **HARCASCADE**
- Who wants to use it in his/her project for detection Faces.
- This Module uses mainly openCV (cv2) library of python for video and other detections

- ***First You need to install some modules to run this file***





## Installation

Go to your Cmd or Python Shell or Anaconda Prompt (if using spyder or Jupyter)

**You need to install 1 Libraries**
- OpenCV (cv2)
```bash
  pip install opencv-python
```

Once it is installed you are good to run the Script or can call it in your own project
:thumsup:

**This Line in the Script is used to import the XML file to your Code.**
- In you need to give the path of the haarcascade file which you downloaded
```bash
  haar_cascade = cv.CascadeClassifier("E:/Extra Codes/Python/Python Programs/OpenCV/Face detection using Haarcascade\haarcascade.xml")
```
